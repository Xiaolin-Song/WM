# Haar-weave-metropolis kernel
###  Kengo kamatani and Xiaolin Song

This project is based on the  paper [Haar-weave-metropolis kernel(arxiv.org/abs/2111.06148)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06148). In this paper, we proposal a new Markov kernel. The Markov kernel can employ the local information of the target distribution using the deterministic proposal, and thanks to the Haar measure, it can employ the global information of the target distribution.  We show through numerical experiments that the performance of the proposed method is superior to other methods in terms of effective sample size and mean square jump distance per second.
